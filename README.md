Docker Scaffold for Drupal
==========================

Provides an barebones, fast, and lightweight local / CI docker environment to work with [Drupal][wxt].

## Setup

Installation is fairly straight forward as long as you are managing your site dependencies with Composer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/drupalwxt/docker-scaffold.git docker
```

> **Note**: This command must be run at the root of the Composer Project where the `composer.json` file exists.
